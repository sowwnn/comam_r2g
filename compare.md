Our method predict:
in comparison with the study of the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged . the degree of pulmonary edema has decreased . continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette . there is some increased opacification at the right base . this most likely represents some combination of asymmetric pulmonary edema and atelectasis . however in the appropriate clinical setting supervening pneumonia would have to
the patient is status post tracheostomy . the right ij central line tip sits in the mid svc . the right internal jugular line is unchanged . the et tube is unchanged . the ng tube tip is not visualized . unchanged bilateral parenchymal opacities reflecting mild pulmonary edema . small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged . no pneumothorax . the size
as compared to the previous radiograph the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed . the lung volumes have slightly decreased and the cardiac silhouette is less well visible . mild bilateral pleural effusions and areas of basal atelectasis persist . there is no evidence for the presence of pneumothorax . the presence of larger pleural effusions cannot be excluded
the heart size is moderately enlarged and there is no overt pulmonary edema but the vascular pedicle appears widened . small bilateral pleural effusions are present . there are bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflective of compressive atelectasis . no pneumothorax is seen . there are no acute osseous abnormalities . clips are noted within the upper abdomen . there is a healed right lower
a left-sided pacemaker and dual leads are in unchanged position . the lungs are mildly hyperinflated . there is no focal consolidation pleural effusion or pneumothorax . the heart size is top normal . the cardiac hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable . a left anterior axillary single lead pacemaker is seen in appropriate position . sternotomy wires are again noted . there is
the lungs are clear without focal consolidation . no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen . the cardiac silhouette is mild to moderately enlarged . mediastinal contours are unremarkable . no pulmonary edema is seen . gaseous distention of the bowel is partially imaged in the upper abdomen . please note that dedicated view or left anterior ribs deformity may be from prior fracture

Related method predict:
ap portable upright view of the chest . overlying ekg leads are present . lung volumes are low limiting assessment . allowing for this there is no convincing evidence for pneumonia or edema . no large effusion or pneumothorax is seen . the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unchanged . bony structures are intact .
as compared to the previous radiograph the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed . the right internal jugular vein catheter and the right internal jugular vein catheter are in unchanged position . there is unchanged evidence of bilateral pleural effusions with subsequent areas of atelectasis at both lung bases . the size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged .
right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid svc . no pneumothorax is identified . lung volumes are low . cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the presence of the low lung volumes . mediastinal contour is unchanged . there is crowding of bronchovascular structures with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion . small bilateral pleural effusions are present . patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis . no acute osseous abnormality is detected .
ap upright and lateral views of the chest provided . lung volumes are markedly low limiting assessment . allowing for this there is no convincing evidence for pneumonia or edema . no large effusion or pneumothorax is seen . the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable . bony structures are intact .
pa and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position . analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of . the heart size remains unchanged and is within normal limits . no typical configurational abnormality is identified . thoracic aorta unremarkable . the pulmonary vasculature is not congested . no signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free . permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position connected to two intracavitary electrodes terminating in right atrial appendage position compatible with the apical portion of
left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle unchanged . moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated . the mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged . pulmonary vasculature is normal . lungs are clear . no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen . there are no acute osseous abnormalities .

Đây là ground truth:
there relatively low lung volumes . there is increased opacity projecting over the right hemi thorax likely due to increased right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis underlying infectious process not excluded . possible trace left pleural effusion . the cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged . mediastinal contours are unremarkable . no pneumothorax is seen .
as compared to the previous radiograph there is unchanged evidence of bilateral parenchymal opacities constant on the right and minimally improving on the left . unchanged cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions . subsequent areas of basal atelectasis . unchanged position of the endotracheal tube and right-sided central venous access line .
as compared to the previous radiograph there is no major change . the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position . small bilateral pleural effusions with evidence of relatively extensive bilateral probably atelectatic consolidations . mild-to-moderate fluid overload . no newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities . extensive calcifications and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta .
there is a somewhat heterogeneous but generally diffuse mild interstitial abnormality suggesting slight pulmonary congestion . one of two views shows a slightly more confluent right upper lobe opacity of uncertain significance quite vague and there is also focal left infrahilar opacity . there is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax .
dual-lead pacer is seen with leads in the right atrium and ventricle as before . there is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion . hyperinflation is again seen compatible with preexisting chronic pulmonary disease . right middle and lower lobe opacities are redemonstrated without new lesions . there is a slight change in morphology with increased lucency of one of the more medial opacities . they are overall unchanged in distribution and as a whole slightly decreased in size . cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged .
the lungs are clear of consolidation effusion or pneumothorax . left chest wall dual lead pacing device is again seen . moderate cardiomegaly is again noted . upper thoracic dextroscoliosis is seen . no acute fracture identified based on this nondedicated exam . surgical clips seen in the upper abdomen .
